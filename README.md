# SAPM_Sensor_BluePill
This is a code for a flood alert system, FEWS (Flood Early Warning System) or in Portuguese SAPI (Sistema de Alerta Prévio de Inundações) the "M" in SAPM comes from de "Modular" version that will accept other types of sensors.
This version runs on STM32 BluePill.

It connects to a LoRa Gateway build with ESP32 **LILYGO-SIM7000G** wich code can be found [here:](https://github.com/alexandreberg/LILYGO-SIM7000G_LoRa_Gateway)

 

This is the code that is running in the Sensor-01 installed in the Bridge-02 in 01/01/2025.

The objective of this code is to generate data for the PCAM master thesis to have at least one year of data for analysis.

The code will be improved in the other sensors that will be installed.
